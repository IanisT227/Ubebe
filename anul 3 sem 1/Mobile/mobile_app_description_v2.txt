Description:
My idea for an app is an online cooking book.
The user will have his own page where he could post his recipe and maybe also upload some pictures. 
The user could save his favourite recipes and have a feed with recommended recipes. 
In addition,if the application is to be expanded, it would also have user to user interaction via a reviews section and maybe a chat section

Domain details:
-Recipe: id, name, difficulty, time, list of ingredients, list of tags(strings and colors) and maybe pictures of the recipe ----> if expanded: reviews from other users
-User: username(string), list of saved recipes ----> if expanded: password(string), first and last name(string), list of published recipes, a profile picture
-Ingredients: name(string), quantity(integer/double)

CRUD:
-Create: a new user(only the name), a new recipe ( with its composing fields)
-Read: user's saved recipes, new recipes for the user's feed
-Update: recipes, user name, list of saved recipes
-Delete: an own recipe, an item from the saved items list

Persistence details:
- the user name will be saved localy
- an own recipe will also be saved on the device
- the favourite recipes will be saved offline, so the user can access it anytime
- publishing a recipe will need the a server call, so it could be uploaded to the global feed
- getting the feed of recipes will also need an internet connection


Details on what is happening when the device is offline:
Notifications:
	- the user could be asked to give a review to a recipe marked as "cooked or done"
	- the user could get a reminder if a recipe is in his favourites section for too long and is not marked as "cooked" or "done"

----> if expanded: -notifications could be created. For instance, if a user has subscribed to another user, and the second one posts a new recipe, the first user could get notified
